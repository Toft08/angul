# Angul-It CAPTCHA Application

A multi-stage CAPTCHA web application built with Angular that challenges users with interactive tasks to verify they are human. This project demonstrates Angular fundamentals including components, services, routing, form validation, state management, and responsive design.

## Project Overview

This project implements an interactive CAPTCHA system with three distinct challenge types:
- Image selection from a grid
- Mathematical problem solving
- Text input verification

The application features persistent state management, route protection, and a responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Angular CLI (optional but recommended)

## Installation & Setup

### Initial Angular Project Setup
```bash
# Create new Angular project
ng new angul-it --routing --style=scss
cd angul-it

# Generate required components
ng generate component components/home
ng generate component components/captcha
ng generate component components/result

# Generate services
ng generate service services/state
ng generate service services/challenge
```

### Development Setup
1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Home Page**: Welcome screen with challenge overview and start button
- **Multi-Stage Challenges**:
  - Image Selection: Select specific images from a 3x3 grid
  - Math Problems: Solve arithmetic equations with various operations
  - Text Input: Type displayed text with case-sensitive validation
- **State Management**: Progress tracking with localStorage persistence
- **Form Validation**: Prevents progression without completing current challenge
- **Route Protection**: Guards prevent unauthorized access to results page
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Results Page**: Performance metrics and completion status

### Technical Implementation
- **Components**: Modular architecture with Home, Captcha, and Result components
- **Services**: StateService for progress tracking, ChallengeService for challenge logic
- **Models**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety and data structure
- **Routing**: Angular Router with functional guards for access control

```

## How It Works

1. **Start**: User clicks "Start Challenge" on the home page
2. **Challenge Progression**: Complete 3 different challenge types in sequence:
   - **Image Selection**: Select all images matching specified criteria from a grid
   - **Math Problems**: Solve randomly generated arithmetic problems
   - **Text Input**: Type displayed text exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
3. **Navigation**: Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate between challenges
4. **Validation**: Each challenge must be completed correctly before progression
5. **Completion**: View detailed results with performance metrics
6. **Restart**: Option to start a new challenge set or return to home

## Security and Validation

- **Route Guards**: Functional guards prevent unauthorized access to results page
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation ensures challenge completion before progression
- **State Persistence**: Progress survives page refreshes using localStorage
- **Random Generation**: Unique challenge sets generated for each session
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper validation for all user inputs

## State Management

The application implements comprehensive state management using Angular services and browser storage:

- **Progress Tracking**: Current challenge index, completed challenges, and user score
- **localStorage Integration**: Automatic save and restore of progress across sessions
- **Results Management**: Challenge completion time, accuracy, and attempt tracking
- **Session Handling**: Unique session identifiers and challenge set persistence
- **Reset Functionality**: Clean slate initialization for new challenge sessions

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

## Technical Requirements Met

This implementation fulfills all project requirements:
