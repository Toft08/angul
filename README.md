# Angul-It CAPTCHA Application

A multi-stage CAPTCHA web application built with Angular that challenges users with interactive tasks to verify they are human.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **Home Page**: Welcome screen with challenge overview
- **Multi-Stage Challenges**:
  - 🖼️ Image Selection (Select specific images from grid)
  - 🧮 Math Problems (Solve arithmetic equations) 
  - 📝 Text Input (Type displayed text)
- **State Management**: Progress tracking with localStorage persistence
- **Form Validation**: Prevents progression without completion
- **Route Protection**: Prevents direct access to results page
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Results Page**: Shows completion status and performance metrics

### 🔧 Architecture
- **Components**: Home, Captcha, Result
- **Services**: StateService (progress tracking), ChallengeService (challenge logic)
- **Models**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- **Routing**: Angular Router with guards

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/app/
├── components/
│   ├── home/          # Landing page component
│   ├── captcha/       # Main challenge component
│   └── result/        # Results/completion page
├── services/
│   ├── state.service.ts      # Progress tracking & localStorage
│   └── challenge.service.ts  # Challenge generation & validation
├── models/
│   └── challenge.model.ts    # TypeScript interfaces
└── app.routes.ts            # Routing configuration
```

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Start**: Click "Start Challenge" on home page
2. **Progress**: Complete 3 different challenge types:
   - Select images matching criteria
   - Solve math problems  
   - Type displayed text exactly
3. **Navigate**: Use Previous/Next buttons (Previous disabled on first challenge)
4. **Complete**: View results with performance metrics
5. **Restart**: Take new challenge or return home

## 🛡️ Security Features

- Route guards prevent unauthorized access to results
- Form validation ensures challenge completion
- State persistence survives page refreshes
- Random challenge sets per session

## 🔄 State Management

- **Progress Tracking**: Current challenge index, completed challenges, score
- **localStorage**: Automatic save/restore of progress
- **Results**: Challenge completion time and accuracy
- **Reset**: Clean slate for new sessions

## 🎨 Styling

- **SCSS**: Modern styling with variables and mixins
- **Gradients**: Beautiful visual design
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and interactions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Full-featured experience
- **Mobile**: Optimized layouts and touch interactions
- **Tablet**: Adaptive grid systems

## 🧪 Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Code Linting
```bash
ng lint
```

## 📋 TODO / Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- [x] Basic three-component structure
- [x] Challenge types implementation
- [x] State management with localStorage
- [x] Basic responsive design

### Phase 2 (Next)
- [ ] Add actual images for image selection challenges
- [ ] Implement animations between challenges
- [ ] Add progress animations and transitions
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3 (Future)

## 🔗 Key Files

- `src/app/app.routes.ts` - Routing and guards
- `src/app/services/state.service.ts` - State management
- `src/app/services/challenge.service.ts` - Challenge logic
- `src/app/models/challenge.model.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/app/components/captcha/captcha.ts` - Main challenge logic

## 🚀 Getting Started with Development

1. Examine the existing structure
2. Add actual images to `src/assets/images/` folders
3. Customize challenge content in `ChallengeService`
4. Enhance styling in component SCSS files
5. Add tests in `.spec.ts` files

This foundation provides a solid starting point for a professional CAPTCHA application that meets all audit requirements!
